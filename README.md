Final Project - EElectrical enrgy consumptions

## Introduction

Today in this world the electrical energy have become the essential energy source in this modern world. Everywhere and every place consumptions of electrical energy is very high. Mainly in Industry sectors, factories and house hold. Even we can say without electricity our life will be very much difficult to find out another source instead of electricity. Having learnt some tools of data analysis, now I want to do some sort of analysis in electrical consumptions in small scale steel industry.

For this analysis I have chosen a data set of electrical energy consumptions in a smart small scale steel industry in South Korea for the month of 2018. With this database I want to be able to make the analysis I want to gather the insights I am looking for regarding correlation between the factors which influence in the energy consumption in this steel industry with the load type whether it is maximum or medium or light load.

The information gathered is from the DAEWOO Steel Co. Ltd in Gwangyang, South Korea. It produces several types of coils, steel plates, and iron plates. The information on electricity consumption is held in a cloud-based system. The information on energy consumption of the industry is stored on the website of the Korea Electric Power Corporation (pccs.kepco.go.kr), and the perspectives on daily, monthly, and annual data.

This data is mainly based on electrical energy consumptions in a small scale steel industry in South Korea. I have decided to do the supervised machine learning on this dataset in order to find out the load types whether it will be light load or medium load or maximum load. With the help of this supervised learning it will be possible to determine what kind of load type during which weekdays or weekend and during which time the load type will be maximum, medium and minimum.

I have retrieve the raw data from UCI repository and I received an overview of the data and then I perform exploratory data analysis and then cleaned it regarding of my observations. Then I really found a challenge in setting up database structures in MySQL and how to create entity-relationship diagram. Finally I have imported cleaned data to MySQL and got some insights in database too.
